# homework_week2 - Portfolio Site
--------------------------------------------------
The week 2 Homework assignment was to make a portfolio website to showcase our work.

The brief is as follows:

```
## User Story


AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position


## Acceptance Criteria


GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## Overview of my website portfolio

```
My website has a fixed header that holds the navigation which links to each section of the site, the logo when clicked scrolls back to top. 
There is a recent photo, my name and a short description. I decided to add a portfolio button to guide the user to the portfolio section to highlight my recent work. 

There is an about section that gives a brief description about me and my background. 
The portfolio section has a few recent examples of my work. Each thumbnail has a hover state that holds the Title and description of each project and link to the live site when clicked. 
The contact section at the bottom of the page holds a form and allows users to send a message and get in touch with me. 

The site is responsive and works across all screen sizes, on phones the portfolio images and contact section stack and go full width.
